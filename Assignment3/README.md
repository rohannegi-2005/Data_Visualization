# Assignment 1: Iris Flower Classification and Visualization  

## üìå Objective  
The objective of this assignment is to classify **Iris flower species** using their sepal and petal measurements.  
We perform:  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** ‚Üí To understand feature patterns with visualizations.  
- **Model Training** ‚Üí Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM.  
- **Model Evaluation** ‚Üí Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report.  
- **Visualization** ‚Üí Pairplot, Boxplot, Heatmap, and Decision Boundaries.

## üìä Dataset  
- **Iris Dataset (in-built sklearn dataset)**  
  - **Features (Inputs):**  
    - Sepal Length (cm)  
    - Sepal Width (cm)  
    - Petal Length (cm)  
    - Petal Width (cm)  
  - **Target (Output):**  
    - Species ‚Üí Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica  
- Total Samples: **150** (50 per species).

## üîé Steps I Followed  

1. **Data Exploration**  
   - Loaded the Iris dataset and converted it into a DataFrame.  
   - Checked summary statistics with `df.describe()` to understand data spread.  
   - Visualized:  
     - **Pairplot** ‚Üí Relationships between all feature pairs, color-coded by species.  
     - **Boxplot** ‚Üí Distribution + median + outliers per species.  
     - **Heatmap (Correlation Matrix)** ‚Üí Feature correlations.  

2. **Model Training**  
   - Split data into **80% training, 20% testing**.  
   - Trained models:  
     - Logistic Regression  
     - Decision Tree  
     - Random Forest  
     - SVM  

3. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Predictions made on test set.  
   - Evaluated using:  
     - **Accuracy Score**  
     - **Confusion Matrix (heatmap)**  
     - **Classification Report (precision, recall, F1-score)**  

4. **Visualization of Decision Boundaries**  
   - Plotted decision regions to show how models separate different flower species.
